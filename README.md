# This is an adventure game written in prolog as part of the coursework for Programming Paradigms Module at Birkbeck College - UCL

Here's what the game is all about..

You're on an treasure hunt. To find the treasure you have to go through different rooms. Navigating through the adventure is done by typing commands. The commands 
are instructions on what you would do and where you want to go. Along the way
you will be provided with simple problems to solve. You will have to use what you 
have with you in the adventure and your brain. If you don't have what it takes, you
will have to find away to go and get it.

To start the adventure you need to bring up a prolog CLI (eg. swipl for Mac)
`shell>swipl`

Onces your're in the prolog CLI, you need to load the game.
`?- consult('adventure.pl').`

Now you can start the game
`?- start.`

Follow the instructions until you find the treasure.

If at any point you need help, just type
`?- help.`
